# dTHREE (Prototype/WIP)

A simple framework for working with three.js from the author of Discover three.js. 

This framework builds on the code from the book Discover three.js, extending it to create a fully fledged but simple template 
for building all kinds of web apps using three.js. Check out the IDE 
on [this page](https://discoverthreejs.com/book/first-steps/animation-system/) for an idea of how it works 
(note that you can also download the code from the IDE as a ZIP file). 

## TODO

- Finalize V0.1 and upload code to GitHub (if you're reading this on GitHub, note that this repo is currently just a stub, there's nothing interesting here yet).
